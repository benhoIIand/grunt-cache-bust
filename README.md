# grunt-cache-bust-key

This is a fork of Ben Holland's excellent [grunt-cache-bust](https://github.com/hollandben/grunt-cache-bust) module altered for my own/internal company use.
Unless you share our very specific use case, you'll probably want to use Ben Holland's original, but in the spirit of open source I've made this available.

> Bust static assets from the cache using content hashing

## Changes
Almost everything from grunt-cache-bust should work as it did at version 1.3.0. Existing tests still pass but there have been a few additions and alterations:

* If you don't want the task to search through files and update references, you can now specify `{jsonOnly: true}`. 
  * No need to create a dummy file for `src` to avoid an error.
  * `{jsonOnly: true}` also implies `{jsonOutput: true}`.
* If you specify `jsonDir` you can control where the json file is created. If undefined it falls back to using `baseDir`.
* When using `jsonOnly`, you can pass in a map of keys and filenames to `assets` instead of a string/array of strings. Example below:
```
assets: {
    'mobile-js': 'assets/mobile.js',
    'theme-x-css': 'theme/x/styles.css'
}
```
Output json will then look something like this:
```
{ 
    "mobile-js":"assets/mobile.3bc124f632c7cdbc.js",
    "core-js":"theme/x/styles.7024c34ca835c674.css"
}
```
**Using globs (e.g. \*\*/\*.{css, js}) while specifying keys & files is not supported**

## Why?
I wanted something that we could use as part of our release process to cache bust our core js & css resource files. grunt-cache-bust mostly fit the bill, but as we have control of the stack, we'd rather read the new filenames from generated json and fall back to non hashed versions by default if there is a problem.
With our case, if something silently breaks in the busting process, some returning visitors may have old cached versions of files, but the site will work just fine for new visitors - as opposed to potentially breaking for every visitor. Raw HTML is for the hardcore.

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install this plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install grunt-cache-bust --save-dev
```

[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/
[Getting Started]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/getting_started.md
[package.json]: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html

## The "cacheBust" task

Use the `cacheBust` task for cache busting static files in your application. This allows the assets to have a large expiry time in the browsers cache and will only be forced to use an updated file when the contents of it changes. This is a good practice.

Tell the `cacheBust` task where your static assets are and the files that reference them and let it work it's magic.

### Supported file types
All of them!!

### How it works
In your project's Gruntfile, add a new task called `cacheBust`.

This is the most basic configuration you can have:

```js
cacheBust: {
    taskName: {
        options: {
            assets: ['assets/**']
        },
        src: ['index.html']
    }
}
```

These are the two mandatory fields you need to supply:

The `assets` option that is passed to the plugin tells it what types of files you want to hash, i.e. `css` and `js` files. You must also provide the location for these files. In the example above, they live in the `assets` folder.

The `src` part of the configuration you should have seen before as it's used by pretty much every Grunt plugin. We use this to tell the plugin which files contain references to assets we're going to be adding a hash to. You can [use the `expand` configuration option here as well](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically)

**To summarise, the above configuration will hash all the files in the `assets` directory and replace any references to those files in the `index.html` file.**

### Options

#### Summary

```
// Here is a short summary of the options and some of their 
defaults. Extra details are below.
{
    algorithm: 'md5',                             // Algorithm used for hashing files
    assets: ['css/*', 'js/*']                     // File patterns for the assets you wish to hash
    baseDir: './',                                // The base directory for all assets
    createCopies: true,                           // Create hashed copies of files
    deleteOriginals: false,                       // Delete the original file after hashing
    encoding: 'utf8',                             // The encoding used when reading/writing files
    hash: '9ef00db36970718e',                     // A user defined hash for every file. Not recommended.
    jsonOutput: false,                            // Output the original => new URLs to a JSON file
    jsonOutputFilename: 'grunt-cache-bust.json',  // The file path and name of the exported JSON. Is relative to baseDir
    length: 16,                                   // The length of the hash value
    separator: '.',                               // The separator between the original file name and hash
    queryString: false                            // Use a query string for cache busting instead of rewriting files
}
```

#### options.algorithm
Type: `String`  
Default value: `'md5'`

`algorithm` is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the version of OpenSSL on the platform. Examples are `'sha1'`, `'md5'`, `'sha256'`, `'sha512'`

#### options.assets
Type: `Array`

`assets` contains the file patterns for where all your assets live. This should point towards all the assets you wish to have busted. It uses the same glob pattern for matching files as Grunt.


#### options.baseDir
Type: `String`  
Default value: `false`

When set, `cachebust` will try to find the assets using the baseDir as base path.

```js
assets: {
    options: {
        baseDir: 'public/',
    },
    files: [{   
        expand: true,
        cwd: 'public/',
        src: ['modules/**/*.html']
    }]
}   
```

#### options.createCopies
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `true`

When set to `false`, `cachebust` will not create hashed copies of the files. Useful if you use server rewrites to serve your files.

#### options.deleteOriginals
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `false`

When set, `cachebust` will delete the original versions of the files that have been hashed. For example, `style.css` will be deleted after being copied to `style.dcf1d324cb50a1f9.css`.

#### options.encoding
Type: `String`  
Default value: `'utf8'`

The encoding of the file contents.

#### options.hash
Type: `String`

A user defined value to be used as the hash value for all files. For a more beneficial caching strategy, it's advised not to supply a hash value for all files.

#### options.jsonOutput
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `false`

When set as `true`, `cachbust` will create a json file with an object inside that contains key value pairs of the original file name, and the renamed md5 hash name for each file.

Output format looks like this:
```
{
  '/scripts/app.js' : '/scripts/app.23e6f7ac5623e96f.js',
  '/scripts/vendor.js': '/scripts/vendor.h421fwaj124bfaf5.js'
}
```

#### options.jsonOutputFilename
Type: `String`  
Default value: `grunt-cache-bust.json`

The file path and name of the exported JSON. It is exported relative to `baseDir`.

#### options.length
Type: `Number`  
Default value: `16`

The number of characters of the file content hash to prefix the file name with.

#### options.separator
Type: `String`  
Default value: `.`

The separator between the original file name and hash.

#### options.queryString
Type: `Boolean`  
Default value: `false`

Use a query string for cache busting instead of rewriting files.

### Usage Examples

#### The most basic setup
```js
cacheBust: {
    taskName: {
        options: {
            assets: ['assets/**']
        },
        src: ['index.html']
    }
}
```

#### Bust using a query string instead of rewriting files
```js
cacheBust: {
    taskName: {
        options: {
            assets: ['assets/**'],
            queryString: true
        },
        src: ['index.html']
    }
}
```

#### Bust all assets and update references in all templates and assets
```js
cacheBust: {
    options: {
        assets: ['assets/**/*'],
        baseDir: './public/'
    },
    taskName: {
        files: [{   
            expand: true,
            cwd: 'public/',
            src: ['templates/**/*.html', 'assets/**/*']
        }]
    }
}
```

#### Inherited options for multiple tasks
```js
cacheBust: {
    options: {
        assets: ['assets/**'],
        baseDir: './public/'
    },
    staging: {
        options: {
            jsonOutput: true
        },
        src: ['index.html']
    },
    production: {
        options: {
            jsonOutput: false
        },
        src: ['index.html']
    }
}
```
